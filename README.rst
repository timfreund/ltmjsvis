ltmjsvis
========

This application visualizes the state of BIGIP LTM partitions and
pools with the help of the following tools:

- pycontrolshed
- pycontrol
- Flask
- D3.js

Right now it's barely functional in that you'll need to hard code 
an environment and partition value in render_partition.js to see 
anything on screen.  It'll get better quickly, and there's enough
here to warrant a copy some place other than my hard drive. 

Annoyed with the app?  Ask for help: @timfreund on twitter or
timfreund on Freenode.
